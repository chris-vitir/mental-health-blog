Mental health is an all-too-frequently **overlooked** aspect of the human experience...

*The aim of this blog is to address this famine of awareness.*

### Pain as Perspective
I have born the burden of mental illness for as long as I can remember, and continue to do so at the time of starting this project.
Out of necessity, I have acquired many skills and techniques to cope with such difficulties, as well as an ever-developing perspective
gleaned from years of much pain, perpetual struggles, and many failures. One thing that mental health professionals seem to agree upon
is that the first step in addressing psychological maladies is acknowledging their existence. We cannot understand that which we do
not accept to be a part of our reality.

### Important things to remember
